## Month → band rule (TBD)

- **Decision**: TBD
- **Owner**: TBD
- **Date**: TBD
- **Notes / context**:
  - TBD: What’s the canonical mapping from a month integer (e.g. 26) to a Phase A age band ID?
  - TBD: Do we clamp months, round, or allow full-range browsing?

## Coverage promise for 23–25m (TBD)

- **Decision**: TBD
- **Owner**: TBD
- **Date**: TBD
- **Promise text (customer-facing)**: TBD
- **Notes / context**:
  - TBD: Are 23–25m and 25–27m both guaranteed to have content at launch?

- **Owner**: TBD
- **Date**: TBD
- **Notes / context**:

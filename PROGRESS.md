## 2025-11-01 â€” Module 1: Baseline Audit & Guardrails

- Added `/SECURITY.md` documenting surfaces, env vars, and RLS (waitlist insert-only; play_idea public select).
- Added `/web/docs/DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md` with preflight, Vercel settings, and rollback steps.
- Added `/web/.env.example` with required public vars (names only).
- Tailwind/PostCSS sanity: aligned files to installed Tailwind major version; local build passes.
- Verified Vercel: Production Branch=`main`, Root Directory=`web`, env vars present in Preview + Production.
- Verified Supabase RLS policies per module objective (waitlist: INSERT anon+authenticated, no SELECT; play_idea: SELECT anon+authenticated).
- Merged PR via **Rebase and merge**: `chore: baseline audit & guardrails (module 1)`.
- Production validation: https://ember-mocha-eight.vercel.app/

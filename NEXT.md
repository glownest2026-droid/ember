# NEXT (Follow-ups, not in this PR)

- Replace placeholder image with local brand-approved asset.
- Consider sticky CTA bar within left surface if CTA drops below fold on some desktops.
- If `pl_seed_products.category_type_id` does not exist (only `category_type_slug`), decide whether slug join is acceptable (and document risks) or add a canonical mapping table (DB change — not in PR3).
- If 23–25m products exist but wrapper rankings/categories need adjustments, handle via Phase A mapping tables (separate PR).
